"""
    Create a python class for storing calendar event data.

    An calendar event consists of:

            start_time
            end_time
            name

    An calendar event provides the following functionality:

            return its duration
            return a string representation of the event
            an equality function that determines if two events have the same name and times
            a function that determines if two events overlap in time
